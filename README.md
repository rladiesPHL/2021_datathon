# About 

The 2021 RLadies Philly datathon aims to connect and enable R enthusiasts in the Philadelphia region (and beyond!) to learn and collaborate while also making a difference in the broader Philadelphia community. This year, we have partnered with the Judge Accountability Table (JAT) to explore judicial patterns in Philadelphia courts and better understand trends through data. Everyone is welcome to participate, and there is no minimum requirement for knowledge about the court system or R proficiency.  

The [Judge Accountability Table (JAT)](https://judgeaccountabilitytable.org/) is a coalition of organizations working toward a shared mission of holding judicial candidates and judges accountable to our community’s vision of justice. The organizations of the JAT include: Reclaim Philadelphia, Project SAFE, Philadelphia DSA – LILAC, 215 People’s Alliance, Philadelphia Community Bail Fund, Youth Art and Self-Empowerment Project, Amistad Law Project, Coalition to Abolish Death By Incarceration (CADBI), The Center for Carceral Communities, ICE out of Courts, Pennsylvania Student Power Network, Make The Road Pennsylvania, DecarceratePA, Black Lives Matter Philadelphia. For this datathon, JAT have made available a dataset of de-identified information related to public court dockets for defendants in Philadelphia County, PA. We hope that this datathon will further their efforts to:

- Explore and describe this rich, messy data more completely (not only by answering specific questions, but also by discovering what additional information would be required to be able to answer these questions)
- Understand best approaches to stratifying and analyzing data
- Understanding predictive factors in carceral outcomes

# Structure

- **March 17, 2021, 6-8pm: [Kickoff Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-philly/events/276365040/):** 
    - First hour: R-Ladies and JAT intros, problem background, Q&A with partner
    - Second hour:  Logistics, data overview, breakout rooms by teams, where participants will be able to join a team and set up a plan of action

- **March 18 - April 19**: 
    - Teams work together using Slack, GitHub, and any other online platform of their choosing (zoom, google meet, etc.). RLadies Philly organizers can set up meetings for teams by request (just contact us on Slack!)
    - Questions to JAT will be compiled into an ongoing Google Doc that will be shared with JAT; JAT will answer questions asynchronously; RLadies Philly organizers will be available on Slack to answer any non-JAT questions
    - While we recommend weekly meetings for teams, teams have the flexibility to set up their workflow as they see fit

 - **April 20:** 
     - Teams should finalize their work and draft a short presentation (approx. 10-15 mins; TBA) of their most important findings for JAT (see [presentation guidelines and template](NEED TO CREATE AND UPDATE)
     - Final reports should be drafted (see [final report guidelines and template](NEED TO CREATE AND UPDATE)

- **April 28, 2021, 6-8pm: [Conclusion Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-philly/events/276365054/):** 
    - Teams will present their results and discuss their experiences. Each team will have the freedom to choose one or more group members to present the team's results, or to request that an R-Ladies Philly organizer presents the team's results if no group members are available to present. The latter option requires some advance coordination.
    - Teams will finalize their reports

# Teams

- **Team 1: Data Visualization**: Visualize judicial patterns at various levels of abstraction, and if possible, create an interactive dashboard:
    - Levels of abstraction: court type, judge name, defendant demographics, crime severity
    - Patterns of interest: 
        - Process: time to disposition 
        - Bail: amount, % misdemeanor cases with return on recognizance (ROR), % of cases that received reductions in bail or changes in bail type
        - Disposition: sentence length
        - Time trends: punitive sentencing, bail decisions for particular types of offenses


- **Team 2: Defining and quantifying judge "harshness**: Conduct research and analyze data to propose metrics and a process for quantifying how harsh a judge is, considering that judges are presented with different kinds of cases (e.g., offense severity). Consider:
    - if and how to stratify cases by severity (or some other characteristic)
    - how to achieve a fair comparison between judges


- **Team 3: Understanding Systemic Trends**: Examine how things have changed in the courts since [Larry Krasner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Krasner) took office in January 2018. Some example trends of interest:
    - Number of people charged overall and by type of charge
    - Harshness in bail and/or sentencing
    - Number of defendants who fail to pay low monetary bail
    - Trends in case dismissals, probation, parole, etc.

**What if I have questions about the data or about court processes/legal terms?**

- JAT have offered to answer questions to the best of their ability via a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UdI0oRUrbXchwpvy8b0CZcKv_3rgBV0YUF1cUix2lyo/edit). Please write your questions in the shared google doc, and JAT volunteers will answer them asynchronously (but regularly).

- If anyone needs help setting up a GitHub account, there will be an organizer to help with this at the event. *If you weren't able to attend the Kickoff Meetup and want to get involved, check out [How to get involved](documentation/get_involved.md).*

**I have a question and I can't find the answer in these resources. Where do I go for help?**

## Process

**I missed the kickoff event. Can I still participate?**

- Yes! Watch the kickoff event video, join our Slack channel, and reach out on slack to the team you would like to join.

**How do I contact a team?**

- Participants will add their names, RLadies Philly Slack IDs and GitHub IDs to [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U6tHOrF_ikBtdFJSj0aT9yfp9jnFqZYIsxcgKBOH9qU/edit?usp=sharing) (new rows can be added), according to the team they are in.
